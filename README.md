# lab1
The lab is split into two different tasks, one for predicting iris flowers and another for predicting wine quality based on various parameters. 
The source code for the iris flower prediction was provided in the assignment, whereas the code for the wine prediction is implemented by ourselves with inspiration from the iris flower prediction code.

## Iris Flower Prediction
Link to folder:

The dataset used to train model:

The model predicts which flower it is between Setosa, and , based on sepal_length, sepal_width, petal_length and petal_width. The model to predict it is trained using the K-nearest-neighbors algorithm.

## Wine Quality Prediction
Link to folder: [Wine Quality](https://github.com/gardaa/ID2223-ScalableML/tree/main/Lab1/wine-quality)

The dataset used to train model:

The model predicts the quality of a wine between 3-9 based on type, fixed acidity, volatile acidity, citric acid, residual sugar, chlorides, free sulfur dioxide, total sulfur dioxide, density, pH, sulphates and alcohol. 
The model to predict it is trained using the RandomForest algorithm.
